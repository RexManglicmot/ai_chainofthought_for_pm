## CustomerCoT

**CustomerCoT** is an AI-powered tool that helps Product Managers interpret customer behavior using long-chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. It analyzes user engagement signals (logins, feature usage, email interactions, support history), distinguishes new vs. existing users, and produces step-by-step reasoning chains that explain:

1) Why a customer might churn, disengage, or upgrade
2) What behavioral signals contribute to that decision
3) What targeted actions (e.g., extend trial, send nudge, trigger onboarding) might help

It differentiates new vs. existing customers, mirrors PM-style reasoning, and recommends lifecycle-specific actions.
